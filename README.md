# i.MX6-Ultra-Lite-SOM-for-IoT-Gateway-Applications
iWave Systems being one of the early adoptors of the i.MX6UL CPU, offering cost effective i.MX6UL0/1/2/3 based system on modules (SOM) intended for various industrial applications where power consumption and form factor are very critical.  The i.MX6UL SODIMM module is integrated for industrial IoT (IIoT) gateway application to enable seamless interconnection of infrastructure devices with secure data flow from end devices to cloud. This gateway platform ensures data generated by devices and systems can reach securely and safely from the edge to the cloud and return without replacement of existing infrastructure. The below diagram shows the i.MX6UL SOM usage for the IIoT gateway application.
